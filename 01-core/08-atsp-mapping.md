# ATSP Hierarchy Integration & Mapping

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: INTRODUCTION -->

## Introduction

This document integrates the ATSP Hierarchy model (Attributes, Traits, Skills, Proficiencies), a core concept in superfunctional training philosophy, with the existing SuperFunctional Training (SFT) Level structure (Levels 0-3). The goal is to provide a clearer conceptual framework for development, showing how each SFT Level contributes to building foundational qualities (Attributes) up to context-specific mastery (Proficiencies). This addresses a key alignment gap identified in the framework analysis.

## ATSP Hierarchy Definitions

Based on superfunctional training philosophy, the hierarchy represents layers of capability:

- **Attributes:** Foundational physical and mental qualities. Raw capacities.
  - _Examples:_ Maximal Strength, Aerobic Capacity, Focus, Mobility, Working Memory.
- **Traits:** Combinations of attributes forming more complex qualities. Often context-independent but require multiple attributes.
  - _Examples:_ Power-Endurance (Strength + Aerobic/Glycolytic Capacity), Resilience (Mental Toughness + Recovery Capacity), Coordination (Mobility + Proprioception + Strength).
- **Skills:** Specific, learned movement patterns or cognitive abilities. Often require specific traits.
  - _Examples:_ Handstand, Kettlebell Snatch, Parkour Vault, Playing Guitar, Coding, Meditation Technique.
- **Proficiencies:** The ability to apply skills effectively and adaptively under specific, often challenging or unpredictable, conditions or contexts. Requires integration of skills, traits, and attributes.
  - _Examples:_ Performing a complex parkour run under pressure, applying martial arts skills in sparring, completing a heavy lift with perfect form when fatigued, maintaining focus during a stressful cognitive task.

## Mapping SFT Levels to ATSP Hierarchy

The SFT Levels (0-3) represent progressive stages of development that build upon each other, contributing to different layers of the ATSP hierarchy.

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: Level0_ATSP_Map -->

### Level 0: Foundation → Focus on Foundational Attributes

- **Primary ATSP Focus:** **Attributes**.
- **Description:** This level establishes the essential physical and mental raw materials. The O.N.E. workout builds baseline strength-endurance (Attribute) and work capacity (Trait). Foundational movement progressions develop basic mobility and motor control (Attributes). Level 0 Brain Training develops foundational focus and body awareness (Attributes).
- **Key Outcomes:** Basic physical preparedness, core stability, fundamental movement competency, baseline cognitive control.
<!-- AI.CONTEXT.END: Level0_ATSP_Map -->

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: Level1_ATSP_Map -->

### Level 1: Pattern Development → Focus on Attributes & Emerging Traits/Skills

- **Primary ATSP Focus:** **Attributes & Traits**, Introduction to **Skills**.
- **Description:** Builds upon foundational attributes with increased volume and complexity. Strength endurance and hypertrophy (Traits) are developed. Compound lifts introduce basic strength Skills. More complex coordination and mind-muscle connection (Traits) are emphasized. Level 1 Brain Training enhances working memory and proprioception (Attributes/Traits).
- **Key Outcomes:** Increased strength and work capacity, proficiency in fundamental loaded patterns, improved mind-muscle connection, basic skill introduction.
<!-- AI.CONTEXT.END: Level1_ATSP_Map -->

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: Level2_ATSP_Map -->

### Level 2: Advanced Integration → Focus on Traits & Skills

- **Primary ATSP Focus:** **Traits & Skills**, Introduction to **Proficiencies**.
- **Description:** Develops key Traits like Power (Strength + Speed Attributes) and Strength Endurance under load. Introduces more complex physical Skills (e.g., components of Olympic lifts, Bent Press). Requires higher-level cognitive Traits like focus under pressure and strategic application of effort. Overload workouts begin to test Proficiencies (applying skills under fatigue). Level 2 Brain Training should target relevant cognitive Traits/Skills.
- **Key Outcomes:** Significant improvements in power and strength, mastery of core compound lifts, ability to handle high intensity, developing Neural-Physical Harmony (Trait).

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: Level3_ATSP_Map -->

### Level 3: Movement Innovation → Focus on Skills & Proficiencies

- **Primary ATSP Focus:** **Skills & Proficiencies**.
- **Description:** Emphasizes mastery of advanced Skills (Handstands, Planche, Levers, complex locomotion) and the ability to apply them creatively and adaptively (Proficiencies). Integrates multiple skills and traits in complex sequences (e.g., Ground Flow, SuperFunctional Integration workouts). Requires high-level cognitive Skills (visualization, problem-solving) and Proficiencies (flow state access under pressure). Level 3 Brain Training should target these advanced cognitive elements.
- **Key Outcomes:** High level of skill mastery, movement creativity, adaptability, consistent flow state access, ability to perform complex tasks under demanding conditions.

## Implementation Notes

- This mapping provides a conceptual overlay. Training within each SFT Level will naturally develop elements across multiple ATSP layers, but the _primary focus_ shifts as described.
- The Unified Goal Framework (`unified_goal_framework`) can be used to target specific ATSP elements within the context of the user's current SFT Level.
- Progression tracking (`progression_tracking`) should ideally incorporate metrics relevant to each ATSP layer being emphasized at the current SFT Level.
- This mapping should inform the future development of Level 2 and 3 Brain Training protocols to ensure they align with the target Traits, Skills, and Proficiencies of those levels.
