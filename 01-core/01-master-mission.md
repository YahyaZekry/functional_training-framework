## TRAINING PHILOSOPHY

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: TRAINING_PHILOSOPHY -->

### Core Identity

**SuperFunctional System Triple Integration:** (Ref: `superfunctional_principles`)

1. Physical Foundation

   - Movement evolution focus
   - Energy system mastery
   - Fascial system development

2. Cognitive Mastery

**Key Philosophical Tenets:**

- **Holistic Development:** Simultaneous, synergistic improvement of mind, body, and lifestyle.
- **Superfunctional Aim:** Training for capability beyond basic function; building resilience and adaptability.
- **Anti-Specialization:** Developing broad, versatile competence across multiple domains rather than maximizing performance in a narrow field.
- **Movement as Core:** Emphasizing natural, functional movement patterns as the foundation.
- **Integration:** Weaving training principles into daily life and environment.
- **Adaptability:** Flexible approach allowing for auto-regulation and context-specific adjustments.

### Integration Priorities
