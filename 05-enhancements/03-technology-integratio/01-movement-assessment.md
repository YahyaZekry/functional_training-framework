<!-- AI.SECTION.START: CORE_CONCEPT -->

## Core Concept

Movement assessment protocols leverage technology to provide objective, real-time feedback on exercise quality, biomechanics, and progress. This supports safer, more effective training and enables data-driven decision-making for users and AI coaches.

**Key Benefits:**

- Early detection of movement errors and compensations
- Personalized corrective feedback
- Quantifiable progress tracking

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: IMPLEMENTATION_PROTOCOLS -->

## Implementation Protocols

### Assessment Tiers

- **Basic:** Smartphone video analysis (manual or app-based)
- **Intermediate:** Wearable devices for joint angle, velocity, and ROM tracking
- **Advanced:** 3D motion capture or force plate integration (where available)

### Feedback Loops

- Real-time form correction prompts
- Automated session summaries with improvement suggestions
- Longitudinal data visualization for user and coach

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: INTEGRATION_GUIDELINES -->

## Integration Guidelines

- Encourage users to record key lifts or skills weekly
- Use wearable feedback during complex or high-risk exercises
- AI system flags movement patterns that deviate from baseline or optimal models
- Integrate assessment results into progression and deload decisions

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: SUCCESS_METRICS -->

## Success Metrics

- Reduction in movement faults over time
- Increased adherence to corrective feedback
- Enhanced rate of skill progression and injury prevention
