<!-- AI.SECTION.START: CORE_CONCEPT -->

## Core Concept

Movement assessment protocols leverage technology across various tiers to provide objective feedback on exercise quality, biomechanics, movement patterns, and progress. This supports safer, more effective training by enabling data-driven individualization, corrective feedback, and progress tracking within the SFT framework.

**Key Benefits:**

- Early detection of movement errors, asymmetries, and compensations.
- Personalized corrective feedback and exercise selection.
- Quantifiable tracking of movement quality and skill progression.
- Enhanced understanding of individual biomechanics.

## Implementation Protocols

### Assessment Tiers & Examples

The choice of technology depends on availability, user goals, and the required level of detail.

- **Tier 1: Basic (Low-Tech / Free / Common Apps)**

  - **Tools:** Smartphone camera, basic video playback/slow-motion apps, printable checklists, potentially free analysis apps or digital versions of manual screens (e.g., apps supporting FMS logging, MAT Assessment digital tools).
  - **Protocols:**
    - Manual video recording of key SFT movements (Squat, Hinge, Push, Pull, Lunge from `movement_assessment_correctives`).
    - Qualitative analysis using checklists focusing on key performance points and common faults.
    - Self-assessment or coach review of recordings.
    - Basic wearable data (e.g., step symmetry from fitness trackers).
  - **Use Case:** Foundational screening, basic form checks, identifying gross movement limitations. Accessible to most users.

- **Tier 2: Intermediate (Wearables / Sensor Systems / Paid Apps)**

  - **Tools:** Wearable IMU sensors (e.g., Athos, PUSH band - for velocity/power), smart clothing, portable force plates (e.g., VALD ForceDecks), specialized assessment systems (e.g., MAT system using 3D motion capture for specific tests like SEBT, YBT, hop tests), paid analysis apps with quantitative features.
  - **Protocols:**
    - Tracking joint angles, range of motion (ROM), movement velocity, power output during key lifts/skills.
    - Quantifying asymmetries in balance tests (e.g., SEBT reach distance via MAT).
    - Assessing jump height, ground contact time, reactive strength index (RSI) using force plates or wearables.
    - Monitoring muscle activation patterns (with smart clothing).
  - **Use Case:** More detailed performance tracking, identifying subtle asymmetries, velocity-based training (VBT), return-to-sport testing, objective progress monitoring for specific goals.

- **Tier 3: Advanced (Lab-Grade / Specialized)**
  - **Tools:** Marker-based 3D motion capture systems (e.g., Vicon, Qualisys), lab-grade force plate arrays (e.g., AMTI, Kistler), integrated EMG systems.
  - **Protocols:**
    - Detailed kinematic analysis (joint angles, velocities, accelerations) during complex, high-speed movements (e.g., sprinting, throwing, advanced parkour).
    - Comprehensive kinetic analysis (ground reaction forces, joint moments, power).
    - Integrated biomechanical and neuromuscular assessment (e.g., combining EMG with motion capture).
  - **Use Case:** Elite athlete performance optimization, in-depth biomechanical research, clinical gait analysis, high-precision diagnostics.

### Feedback Loops

- **Real-time:** Some wearables/apps provide immediate feedback on ROM, velocity, or form deviations during the exercise.
- **Session Summary:** Automated reports highlighting key metrics, deviations from norms/baseline, and potential areas for improvement.
- **Longitudinal Tracking:** Visualization of progress over time for specific movement quality metrics (e.g., squat depth, push-up stability score, balance time). AI systems can analyze trends to inform periodization and progression.

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: INTEGRATION_GUIDELINES -->

## Integration Guidelines

- **Frequency:** Perform baseline SFT Movement Screen (`movement_assessment_correctives`) initially and re-assess periodically (e.g., every 4-8 weeks). Use technology-aided assessment for specific focus areas as needed (e.g., weekly video review of a key lift, daily balance check with app).
- **Tool Selection:** AI should recommend appropriate assessment tier/tools based on user goals, SFT Level, and stated technology access.
- **Data Interpretation:** AI should assist in interpreting assessment results, flagging significant deviations or asymmetries based on normative data or user's baseline.
- **Corrective Link:** Assessment results should directly inform corrective strategies (Mobilize, Activate, Integrate) outlined in `movement_assessment_correctives`. AI can suggest relevant corrective exercise categories based on identified limitations.
- **Progression:** Use objective assessment data to guide progression decisions within `workout_implementation` and `level_transition_guidelines`. Deloads (`recovery_implementation`) may be triggered by declining movement quality scores.

## Success Metrics

- Improvement in scores on the SFT Movement Screen over time.
- Quantifiable improvements in specific metrics tracked by technology (e.g., increased ROM, reduced asymmetry, improved velocity).
- Reduction in movement faults identified during qualitative or quantitative analysis.
- Increased user adherence to corrective exercise recommendations based on assessment feedback.
- Correlation between improved assessment scores and enhanced performance/reduced injury rates (long-term).

## System Protection

- **Privacy & Security:** Ensure user consent and secure storage/handling of potentially sensitive movement data.
- **Clear Instructions:** Provide detailed guidance for performing self-assessments safely and accurately, especially when using technology.
- **Avoid Over-Reliance:** Technology is a tool; do not neglect fundamental coaching observation and subjective feedback. Ensure basic movement competency before relying heavily on advanced metrics.
- **Context is Key:** Interpret data within the context of the individual's goals, history, and overall well-being. Avoid making drastic training changes based on single data points or potential false positives.
