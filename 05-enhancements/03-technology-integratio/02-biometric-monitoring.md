## Core Concept

Biometric monitoring uses wearables and apps to track physiological signals (HRV, heart rate, sleep, recovery) for optimizing training load, recovery, and readiness. This supports personalized, data-driven training adjustments. (See component: recovery_implementation for integration).

**Key Benefits:**

- Personalized recovery and readiness feedback
- Early detection of fatigue and overtraining risk
- Data-driven training adjustments

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: IMPLEMENTATION_PROTOCOLS -->

## Implementation Protocols

### Monitoring Tiers

- **Basic:** Resting heart rate and sleep tracking (smartphone or basic wearable)
- **Intermediate:** HRV and activity monitoring (fitness tracker or smart ring)
- **Advanced:** Multi-metric dashboards (integrated with AI for auto-adjustment)

### Feedback Loops

- Daily readiness scores and training recommendations
- Weekly trend analysis for recovery and adaptation
- AI-generated alerts for abnormal patterns or risk

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: INTEGRATION_GUIDELINES -->

## Integration Guidelines

- Encourage daily biometric check-ins for high-frequency users
- Use recovery data (See component: recovery_implementation) to auto-adjust intensity and volume
- Integrate with movement assessment for holistic user profile

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: SUCCESS_METRICS -->

## Success Metrics

- Improved recovery and reduced injury rates (See component: recovery_implementation)
- Increased training consistency and user satisfaction
- Early intervention for overtraining or illness

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: SYSTEM_PROTECTION -->

## System Protection

- Respect user privacy and secure data storage
- Avoid unnecessary training restrictions from false positives
- Educate users on interpreting biometric data
