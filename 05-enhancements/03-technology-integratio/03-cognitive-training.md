<!-- AI.SECTION.START: CORE_CONCEPT -->

## Core Concept

Cognitive training protocols integrate digital tools and neurofeedback to enhance working memory, processing speed, and mental resilience alongside physical training.

**Key Benefits:**

- Improved cognitive performance and adaptability
- Enhanced dual-task and decision-making capacity
- Supports holistic SuperFunctional development

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: IMPLEMENTATION_PROTOCOLS -->

## Implementation Protocols

### Training Tiers

- **Basic:** App-based memory and focus games (e.g., Dual N-Back, Lumosity)
- **Intermediate:** Combined physical-cognitive drills (movement + task)
- **Advanced:** Neurofeedback and custom AI-generated cognitive plans

### Feedback Loops

- Regular cognitive testing with progress charts
- Adaptive training difficulty based on performance
- AI recommendations for targeted brain training modules

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: INTEGRATION_GUIDELINES -->

## Integration Guidelines

- Schedule cognitive training 2â€“4x per week, alternating with physical sessions
- Integrate cognitive tasks into warm-ups or active recovery
- Use results to inform progression in both mental and physical domains
