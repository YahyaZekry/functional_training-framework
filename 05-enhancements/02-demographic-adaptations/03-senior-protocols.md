<!-- AI.SECTION.START: CORE_CONCEPT -->

## Core Concept

Senior protocols adapt the SuperFunctional Training System for older adults (approx. ages 60/65+), emphasizing the maintenance or improvement of functional independence, mobility, strength, power, balance, and cognitive health. The primary goals are to mitigate age-related decline (sarcopenia, osteopenia, dynapenia), reduce fall risk, enhance quality of life, and support continued engagement in meaningful activities through safe, progressive, and individualized training.

**Key Benefits:**

- Maximizes safety and confidence for seniors
- Supports independence and daily function
- Maintains neuroplasticity and cognitive health.
- Combats sarcopenia and improves muscle quality.
- Enhances bone density and reduces fracture risk.
- Improves balance and reduces fall risk significantly.
- Supports cardiovascular health and metabolic function.

## Training Protocols

**General Guidelines (Based on NSCA/ACSM recommendations):**

- **Frequency:** 2-3 non-consecutive days per week for resistance/power; balance/mobility daily or most days.
- **Intensity:**
  - Strength: Moderate to high (e.g., 70-85% 1RM or RPE 5-8 on a 10-point scale) if tolerated and technique is excellent. Start lower (e.g., 50-60% 1RM) if deconditioned or with limitations.
  - Power: Lower intensity (e.g., 40-60% 1RM) with focus on movement velocity.
- **Volume:** 1-3 sets of 8-12 repetitions for strength; potentially lower reps (e.g., 6-10) for power exercises.
- **Exercise Selection:** Prioritize multi-joint exercises targeting major muscle groups relevant to daily function (legs, hips, back, chest, shoulders). Include specific balance and mobility exercises.

### Functional Strength & Power Progressions

- **Beginner:**
  - Sit-to-stand (chair squats) progressing to unsupported bodyweight squats.
  - Wall push-ups progressing to incline push-ups.
  - Supported balance work (single leg stance with hand support).
  - Controlled floor descents/ascents practice.
  - Light resistance band rows/presses.
- **Intermediate:**
  - Goblet squats (light weight), Leg press machine.
  - Resistance band exercises (rows, presses, pull-aparts).
  - Step-ups onto low box.
  - Basic power: Seated medicine ball throws (light), fast sit-to-stands.
  - Perturbation balance training (light nudges from partner while standing).
  - Heel-to-toe walking.
- **Advanced:**
  - Trap bar deadlifts (light, focus on hinge), Dumbbell bench press.
  - Faster velocity resistance exercises (e.g., faster leg press concentric).
  - Multi-directional stepping/lunging patterns.
  - Gentle loaded carries (light dumbbells/kettlebells).
  - Dynamic balance walking (figure eights, obstacles).

### Balance & Mobility Integration

- **Static Balance:** Single-leg stance (progressing duration, eyes closed, unstable surface). Tandem stance.
- **Dynamic Balance:** Heel-toe walking, step-overs, multi-directional stepping, Tai Chi.
- **Mobility:** Focus on ankle, hip, thoracic spine, and shoulder mobility using dynamic and static stretches appropriate for limitations.

### Neural Integration

- **Cognitive-Motor Pairing:** Naming objects/categories while walking, recall tasks during balance holds, simple calculations during sit-to-stands.
- **Gait Variability Drills:** Walking with varied step length, direction changes on cue, walking over small obstacles.
- **Reactive Balance:** Step quickly in response to a light push or verbal cue, partner ball toss while balancing.
- **Social Movement:** Group exercise classes, cooperative balance games.

## Integration Guidelines

- Use as a stand-alone senior program or as modifications to the main SuperFunctional framework. See [`00-demographic-integration-overview.md`](../00-demographic-integration-overview.md) for general principles.
- **SFT Levels:** Seniors can operate within any SFT Level (0-3) based on capability, but progression may be slower. Focus within levels often shifts towards maintaining function, power, and balance rather than solely pushing peak strength/skill limits. Level 0/1 foundational work is often highly relevant.
- **Workout System (`01-workout-system.md`):** Modify exercise selection for safety and joint health (e.g., machine/band options, reduced impact). Emphasize power maintenance with appropriate intensity (e.g., 40-60% 1RM, faster concentric). Volume should be carefully managed based on recovery.
- **Recovery System (`05-recovery-system.md`):** Recovery capacity is reduced; allow more rest days or implement deloads more frequently. Emphasize mobility, balance work, and adequate sleep. Monitor closely for overreaching.
- **Brain Training (`03-brain-training-system.md`):** Focus on cognitive-motor tasks, processing speed, memory, and executive function relevant to daily life and fall prevention.
- **Progression:** Base progression on competency, functional improvements (see Success Metrics), and consistent technique, not just age. Use metrics from `03-progression-tracking.md` adapted for seniors.
- **Emphasis:** Prioritize safety, support, enjoyment, and gradual progression in all aspects.

## Success Metrics

- **Functional Measures:** Improved scores on standardized tests like Timed Up and Go (TUG), Chair Stand Test (30-second), Gait Speed (e.g., 4-meter walk test).
- **Balance:** Increased duration for single-leg stance (eyes open/closed), improved performance on dynamic balance tests (e.g., Berg Balance Scale components).
- **Strength/Power:** Maintenance or improvement in relevant strength metrics (e.g., grip strength, leg press 1RM) and power measures (e.g., chair stand power, jump height if appropriate).
- **Subjective:** Increased confidence in performing daily activities, reduced fear of falling, improved self-reported quality of life.
- **Adherence:** Consistent participation in the program.
- **Progression:** Demonstrated ability to safely progress through exercise variations or increase load/volume over time.

## System Protection

- **Screening:** Utilize pre-participation health screening (e.g., PAR-Q+) to identify contraindications or conditions requiring medical clearance/monitoring.
- **Technique Focus:** Prioritize correct form over lifting heavy weight. Ensure proper breathing technique (avoid Valsalva maneuver if hypertensive).
- **Exercise Modification:** Avoid or modify exercises contraindicated by specific conditions (e.g., avoid spinal flexion/rotation with osteoporosis, manage load with arthritis). Use seated or supported variations where needed.
- **Warm-up/Cool-down:** Include thorough warm-ups focusing on mobility and activation, and cool-downs emphasizing gentle stretching.
- **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor blood pressure (if relevant), perceived exertion (RPE), and signs of fatigue, dizziness, or pain. Adjust training based on daily readiness and health status.
- **Environment:** Ensure a safe, well-lit training environment free of hazards. Use appropriate footwear and assistive devices if necessary.
- **Gradual Progression:** Increase volume or intensity slowly, allowing ample time for adaptation. Ensure mastery before advancing complexity or load.
