<!-- AI.SECTION.START: CORE_CONCEPT -->

## Core Concept

Midlife protocols adapt the SuperFunctional Training System for adults aged 35â€“55, focusing on joint-friendly strength, power, and sustainable performance. The aim is to maintain and enhance functional capacity, resilience, and neuroplasticity while minimizing injury risk.

**Key Benefits:**

- Optimizes training for busy, adaptive lifestyles
- Supports joint health and recovery
- Maintains high-level functional performance

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: TRAINING_PROTOCOLS -->

## Training Protocols

### Progression Examples

- **Beginner:** Controlled tempo resistance training, step-ups, banded mobility
- **Intermediate:** Medicine ball throws, trap bar jumps, kettlebell swings
- **Advanced:** Complex training (pairing heavy lifts with explosive moves), loaded carries, multi-planar lunges

### Neural Integration

- Unilateral balance work (single-leg RDLs, balance boards)
- Cognitive-motor dual-tasking (counting, memory recall during movement)
- Reaction drills (agility cone changes, partner cues)

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: INTEGRATION_GUIDELINES -->

## Integration Guidelines

- Use as a stand-alone midlife program or as modifications to the main SuperFunctional framework.
- For detailed guidance on how these protocols modify core SFT components (Levels, Workouts, Recovery, Modes, Brain Training), refer to the central [`00-demographic-integration-overview.md`](./00-demographic-integration-overview.md).
- Progress based on competency, not just age.
- Prioritize recovery and joint health in programming.
- Reassess quarterly for adaptation and safety.

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: SUCCESS_METRICS -->

## Success Metrics

- Maintenance or improvement of strength, power, and mobility benchmarks
- Improved cognitive-motor performance
- Reduced injury rates or joint discomfort
- Demonstrated progression through protocol levels over time
<!-- AI.SECTION.END: SUCCESS_METRICS -->

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: SYSTEM_PROTECTION -->

## System Protection

- Prioritize movement quality and recovery over intensity
- Adjust progression for life stress and recovery needs
- Monitor for signs of joint stress or overuse
- Encourage regular deloads and mobility work
