<!-- AI.SECTION.START: CORE_CONCEPT -->

## Core Concept

Youth protocols adapt the SuperFunctional Training System for adolescents (approx. ages 12–18), focusing on developing fundamental movement skills (movement literacy), coordination, strength foundations, and fostering enjoyment in physical activity through playful skill acquisition. Aligns with Long-Term Athletic Development (LTAD) principles, aiming to build a robust foundation for lifelong physical competence, neural development, and injury resilience.

**Key Benefits:**

- Maximizes safety and engagement for youth
- Encourages skill diversity and neuroplasticity
- Supports healthy growth and development during adolescence.
- Reduces risk of sports-related injuries through improved neuromuscular control.
- Establishes positive long-term relationships with exercise and physical activity.

## Training Protocols

**General Guidelines (Based on NSCA recommendations):**

- **Frequency:** 2-3 non-consecutive days per week.
- **Duration:** 20-40 minutes per session (can be longer if including significant game/play elements).
- **Volume:** Start with 1-2 sets of 6-15 repetitions per exercise. Progress volume gradually before intensity.
- **Intensity:** Focus on technical mastery with bodyweight or light loads. Resistance should allow completion of reps with excellent form. Avoid maximal lifts until late adolescence/skeletal maturity.
- **Exercise Selection:** Prioritize multi-joint, compound movements that mimic fundamental patterns (squat, hinge, push, pull, lunge, carry, rotate). Include balance, coordination, and agility drills.

### Foundational Movement Progressions (Examples linking to SFT Levels)

- **Beginner (Aligns with SFT Level 0 Focus):**
  - Bodyweight Squats, Lunges, Push-up variations (wall, knee).
  - Animal movement flows (bear crawl, crab walk, frog jump).
  - Basic balance drills (single-leg stance).
  - Introduction to core bracing (plank, bird-dog).
- **Intermediate (Aligns with SFT Level 1 Focus):**
  - Goblet Squats (light weight), Dumbbell Rows, Assisted Pull-ups/Inverted Rows.
  - Handstand progressions (against wall), rolling patterns, basic plyometrics (box jumps - low height, jump rope).
  - More complex balance drills (eyes closed, unstable surfaces - light).
  - Introduction to medicine ball throws/slams (light).
- **Advanced (Aligns with SFT Level 1+/2 Focus - Requires Demonstrated Competency):**
  - Barbell Squats/Deadlifts (light load, technique focus), Overhead Press (light).
  - More advanced bodyweight skills (freestanding handstand attempts, cartwheels).
  - Intermediate plyometrics (bounding, hurdle hops).
  - Light loaded carries (farmer's walks, suitcase carries).

### Strength & Resistance Training Considerations

- **Technique First:** Perfecting form is paramount before adding external load. Use tools like PVC pipes or light dumbbells initially.
- **Gradual Loading:** Increase resistance by only 5-10% once technical competency is achieved at a given load for the target rep range.
- **Supervision:** Qualified supervision is essential to monitor technique and ensure safety.
- **Avoid Overtraining:** Monitor for signs of fatigue, burnout, or excessive soreness, especially during growth spurts. Ensure adequate recovery and sleep.

### Neural Integration & Skill Acquisition

- **Focus:** Reaction time drills (ball drops, partner tag), spatial awareness games (agility ladder, cone drills), coordination challenges (mirror drills, rhythm games), basic plyometrics.
- **Method:** Emphasize fun, game-based learning. Integrate cognitive challenges (Dual-Task) appropriate for age (e.g., simple counting during drills).
- **Goal:** Improve coordination, agility, balance, and reactivity – crucial components of athleticism and injury prevention.

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: INTEGRATION_GUIDELINES -->

## Integration Guidelines

- Use as a stand-alone youth program or as modifications to the main SuperFunctional framework. See [`00-demographic-integration-overview.md`](../00-demographic-integration-overview.md) for general principles.
- **SFT Levels:** Youth typically progress through Levels 0 and 1, focusing on skill mastery. Transition to Level 2 requires demonstrated physical maturity and consistent technical excellence. Progression rate can be faster for skills but slower for load increases compared to adults.
- **Workout System (`01-workout-system.md`):** Prioritize bodyweight exercises and skill progressions from Levels 0/1. Substitute high-load exercises with technique-focused or lighter variations. Emphasize multi-joint movements.
- **Recovery System (`05-recovery-system.md`):** Emphasize adequate sleep (8-10+ hours) for growth and recovery. Ensure sufficient caloric intake, especially protein. Active recovery through play/light activity is encouraged. Deloads may be needed more frequently during intense growth periods.
- **Brain Training (`03-brain-training-system.md`):** Focus on Level 0/1 protocols emphasizing learning, memory, focus, and coordination. Game-based cognitive exercises are often effective.
- **Progression:** Base progression on demonstrated competency and technical proficiency, not just age. Use metrics from `03-progression-tracking.md` adapted for youth (e.g., movement quality scores, skill milestones).
- **Engagement:** Encourage play, exploration, and variety to maintain motivation and foster a positive relationship with movement.

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: SUCCESS_METRICS -->

## Success Metrics

- Improved fundamental movement skill competency (squat, hinge, push, pull, balance, locomotion).
- Increased coordination, agility, and balance scores (using appropriate youth assessment tools).
- Consistent participation and expressed enjoyment in physical activity.
- Reduced incidence of non-contact injuries in sports/activities (long-term metric).
- Demonstrated progression through skill levels and appropriate load increases over time.

## System Protection

- **Qualified Supervision:** Essential for teaching correct technique and managing loads safely.
- **Technique Over Load:** Always prioritize perfect form. Stop sets if technique breaks down.
- **Growth Plate Awareness:** Avoid maximal lifts and excessive high-impact plyometrics, especially during peak growth spurts, until skeletal maturity is reached. Consult medical professionals if concerns arise.
- **Warm-up/Cool-down:** Implement dynamic warm-ups before sessions and static stretching/mobility work after.
- **Listen to the Body:** Teach youth to recognize signs of fatigue or pain and communicate them. Adjust training based on recovery, sleep, nutrition, and external stressors (school, etc.).
- **Screening:** Use pre-participation screening where possible to identify potential risks.
- **Monitor:** Watch for signs of overuse injuries, burnout, or disengagement. Ensure adequate rest and recovery periods.
