<!-- AI.CONTEXT: EnvironmentalAdaptationIntegration -->

### Environmental Adaptation Integration

- Actively seek opportunities to interact with varied environments as part of lifestyle integration.
- **Examples:** Take walks/runs on different terrains (trails, sand, hills), practice balance on uneven surfaces (curbs, logs - safely), expose yourself to varied weather conditions (within safe limits), utilize park benches/walls for incidental exercises.
- **Goal:** Enhance adaptability, proprioception, and resilience by treating the everyday environment as a training ground. (See component: `foundation_environmental_adaptation` for core concepts).
