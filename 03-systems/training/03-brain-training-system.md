## MEDITATION TECHNIQUES

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: MEDITATION_TECHNIQUES -->

### Mindfulness Protocol

{ref: mind_body_integration.mental_state_management}

- **IMPLEMENTATION:**

  1.  Environment

      - Quiet space
      - Comfortable position
      - Limited distractions
      - Timer setup

  2.  Practice

      - Focus on breath
      - Notice thoughts
      - Return attention
      - Stay neutral
      - Maintain posture

  3.  Progression
      - Start: 5 minutes
      - Build to: 20 minutes
      - Quality over quantity
      - Regular practice

### Body Scan Protocol

- **SEQUENCE:** 1. Initial Setup - Lying position - Eyes closed - Relaxed breathing 2. Progression - Start at feet - Move upward - Notice sensations - Release tension - Maintain awareness

### Focused Attention / Open Monitoring (Advanced)

- **Focused Attention:** Maintain unwavering focus on a single object (breath, sensation, mantra) resisting distractions. Progress by increasing duration or introducing controlled distractions.
- **Open Monitoring:** Cultivate non-judgmental awareness of all arising phenomena (thoughts, sounds, sensations) without latching onto any single one. Observe the flow of experience.
