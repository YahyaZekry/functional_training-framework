# Brain Training & Physical Progression Integration Map

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: INTRODUCTION -->

## Introduction

This document maps specific brain training protocols from the SFT Brain Training Implementation Framework (`brain_training_implementation`) to corresponding physical development levels and skills within the SFT framework (`unified_intervention_system`, `workout_implementation`). The goal is to explicitly define how cognitive enhancements support and integrate with physical progression, fostering Neural-Physical Harmony.

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: INTEGRATION_BY_SFT_LEVEL -->

## Integration by SFT Level

This section outlines the primary brain training focus intended to support the physical and cognitive demands of each SFT Level.

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: Level0_BrainIntegration -->

### Level 0: Foundation

- **Physical Focus:** Basic pattern mastery, coordination, body awareness.
- **Brain Training Focus (`brain_training_implementation` - Level 0):**
  - **Mindfulness Meditation:** Enhances body awareness, focus, and interoception crucial for learning new movements. Supports `workout_implementation` focus on movement awareness.
  - **Dual N-Back (N=1):** Builds foundational working memory and attention control needed for tracking movement cues and sequences.
  - **Mental Exercise (Basic):** Simple visualization of correct movement patterns.
  - **Non-Dominant Hand Training (Basic):** Introduces novel motor control challenges, promoting neuroplasticity.
- **Integration Goal:** Establish baseline focus, body awareness, and cognitive control to support learning fundamental movements.

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: Level1_BrainIntegration -->

### Level 1: Pattern Development

- **Physical Focus:** Complex patterns, strength progression, pattern stability.
- **Brain Training Focus (`brain_training_implementation` - Level 1):**
  - **Body Scan Meditation:** Deepens proprioceptive awareness and mind-muscle connection needed for strength gains and complex patterns. Supports `workout_implementation` focus on mind-muscle connection.
  - **Dual N-Back (Progressing N):** Increases working memory capacity to handle more complex workout structures and exercise sequences.
  - **Mental Exercise (Visualization):** Detailed visualization of complex movement sequences and successful lifts.
  - **Non-Dominant Hand Training (Integration):** Enhances fine motor control and cross-hemispheric communication, supporting complex coordination.
  - **Flow State Development (Intro):** Begin practicing techniques to enter flow during skill practice or less demanding sets. Supports `workout_implementation` focus on flow state.
- **Integration Goal:** Enhance focus, proprioception, and working memory to manage increased complexity in physical training and foster mind-muscle connection.

### Level 2: Advanced Integration

- **Physical Focus:** Movement mastery, power development, energy efficiency, neural-physical harmony.
- **Brain Training Focus (`brain_training_implementation` - Level 2):**
  - **Advanced Meditation (Focused Attention/Open Monitoring):** Develops wider awareness and focus control under potential distraction.
  - **High-Load Cognitive Training:** Advanced N-Back (N=3+), complex problem-solving/strategic thinking exercises.
  - **Advanced Visualization:** Visualizing power output, technical precision under load, managing fatigue.
  - **State Management:** Arousal control techniques (tactical breathing, psych-up routines).
  - **Integration Practice:** Pairing cognitive tasks with relevant physical drills (e.g., calculations during cardio, memory recall during balance).
- **Integration Goal:** Develop high-level cognitive control, focus under pressure, and strategic thinking required for power development and advanced movement integration.

## Implementation Notes

- This map provides a framework. Specific pairings should be guided by individual needs and the detailed protocols in the respective Brain Training (`brain_training_implementation`) and Workout System (`workout_implementation`) documents.
- Neuromuscular integration drills (Dual-Task, Proprioceptive, Reactive) serve as practical methods for implementing brain-physical integration directly within workouts.
- AI systems should use this map to recommend synergistic brain training activities based on the user's current physical training focus and SFT Level.
