# SFT AI Framework: Progress and Next Steps

## I. What We Have Done (Key Accomplishments)

1.  **Core Framework Structure Established (`AI_version/` directory):**

    - **SFT Parser (`sft_parser/parser.py`):** Developed to parse markdown documents from the SFT framework, extracting structured content items (documents, sections, paragraphs, lists, etc.) and their metadata.
    - **Core Models (`core_models/`):** Defined Pydantic models for `SFTContentItem`, `Client`, and `Goal`, providing data validation and structure.
    - **State Manager (`state_manager/state_manager.py`):** Implemented to load, store, and retrieve SFT content items, client data, and goals in memory.
    - **Abstract LLM Service (`llm_integration/llm_service.py`):** Created an abstract base class `LLMService` defining a common interface for LLM interactions (sentiment analysis, entity extraction, chat response, utterance analysis). Initial version had mock implementations.
    - **Decision Logic Engine (`logic_engine/decision_engine.py`):**
      - Developed logic to determine a client's SFT level based on assessment data.
      - Implemented `recommend_communication_mode` to select an appropriate SFT communication mode (DEFAULT, WARRIOR, DARKKNIGHT) based on client's explicit emotional state, text triggers, and (mocked) nuanced emotion from LLM analysis. This involved significant refinement and debugging.
      - Implemented `generate_coaching_prompt` to create contextual coaching questions/statements based on client analysis and the current communication mode, using the LLM service.
      - Implemented `personalize_sft_item` to adapt SFT content for a specific client using their profile, goals, recent analysis, and context tags, leveraging the LLM service.
      - Basic workout plan outline generation (`generate_workout_plan_outline`).
    - **Perplexity LLM Service (`llm_integration/perplexity_llm_service.py`):**
      - Created a concrete implementation of `LLMService` specifically for Perplexity AI.
      - Refactored all its methods to clearly define prompt structures for an AI agent (me) to use with the `perplexity-mcp` tool.
      - Added private helper methods (`_process_..._mcp_response`) to parse and clean typical raw responses from the Perplexity MCP (handling `<think>` blocks, citations, JSON extraction).
      - Retained simple mock logic within the primary service methods for direct execution by `app.py` for testing.
    - **Testing (`app.py`):** Continuously updated to test new features, including mode detection, coaching prompt generation, content personalization, and ensuring the correct LLM service (`PerplexityLLMService`) is utilized.
    - **Version Control:**
      - Created a new Git branch `feature/advanced-llm-integration`.
      - Committed all framework files to this branch.
      - Pushed the branch to the remote GitHub repository.
      - Added a `.gitignore` file to exclude `__pycache__` and other unnecessary files.

2.  **Sequential Thinking Plan:**
    - Utilized the `sequentialthinking` MCP tool to outline a comprehensive roadmap for making the framework "fully complete," covering:
      1.  Real LLM Integration (current focus)
      2.  Enhanced Core Coaching Logic
      3.  Data Persistence
      4.  Basic API Layer
      5.  Expanded SFT Content Utilization
      6.  User Interaction Loop

## II. Where We Are Now

- The foundational Python classes for parsing, state management, decision logic, and LLM interaction are in place.
- The `PerplexityLLMService` is structurally ready for an AI agent (me) to make live calls to the Perplexity AI via the `perplexity-mcp` tool. The methods define the necessary prompts, and helper functions are available to process the raw responses from the MCP.
- The framework can successfully determine communication modes, generate (mock) coaching prompts, and (mock) personalize content based on a variety of inputs and client data.
- All current code is on the `feature/advanced-llm-integration` branch and pushed to GitHub.
- We have just finished preparing `PerplexityLLMService` for live MCP calls by demonstrating (through simulated agent interactions) how each of its methods would guide an agent and how their respective `_process_..._mcp_response` helpers would handle the output from the `perplexity-mcp` tool.

## III. What We Will Do Next (Immediate Steps)

The immediate next step is to **begin implementing live Perplexity AI interactions within the `PerplexityLLMService` methods by having the AI agent (me) use the `perplexity-mcp` tool and then use the corresponding `_process_..._mcp_response` helper methods to handle the results.**

This will be done method by method:

1.  **Live Test: `analyze_sentiment` with MCP Call and Processing**

    - **Action**: I (Cline, the AI agent) will be given a piece of text.
    - I will consult `PerplexityLLMService.analyze_sentiment` for the prompt structure.
    - I will use the `<use_mcp_tool>` tag to call `perplexity-mcp`'s `chat_perplexity` tool with the appropriate prompt.
    - You (the user) will provide the raw JSON result from the MCP tool.
    - I will then (conceptually, as I can't execute Python directly) use `PerplexityLLMService._process_sentiment_mcp_response(raw_mcp_result)` to get the final `Sentiment` value.
    - **Goal**: Confirm end-to-end flow for sentiment analysis using the live MCP.

2.  **Live Test: `extract_entities` with MCP Call and Processing**

    - Similar process: define text and entity types, I make the MCP call, you provide the result, I use `_process_entities_mcp_response`.
    - **Goal**: Confirm end-to-end flow for entity extraction.

3.  **Live Test: `generate_chat_response` with MCP Call and Processing**

    - Define prompt, SFT mode, and (optionally) history. I make the MCP call, you provide result, I use `_process_chat_mcp_response`.
    - **Goal**: Confirm end-to-end flow for chat response generation.

4.  **Live Test: `analyze_client_utterance` with MCP Call and Processing**
    - Define client utterance. I make the MCP call, you provide result, I use `_process_analysis_mcp_response`.
    - **Goal**: Confirm end-to-end flow for detailed utterance analysis.

**Beyond these immediate tests (Longer-Term from Sequential Thinking Plan):**

- **Refine Core Logic**: Update `DecisionLogicEngine` to fully leverage the rich, _real_ outputs from the live `PerplexityLLMService`.
- **Data Persistence**: Implement SQLite database support in `StateManager`.
- **API Layer**: Develop FastAPI endpoints.
- And so on, following the roadmap.

This outline should provide a clear picture of our progress and the path forward.
