# Mode Implementation Quick Reference Guide

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: INTRODUCTION -->

## Introduction

This guide provides a quick reference for the practical application and distinguishing characteristics of the standardized operational modes within the SuperFunctional Training System: Default Mode, Warrior Mode, and DarkKnight Mode. These modes adapt the training approach, communication style, and psychological framing to best suit the user's context, while upholding the core principles of the SFT. Refer to `00-framework-glossary.md` for foundational definitions.

<!-- AI.CONTEXT.END: DefaultMode_Metrics -->

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: DefaultMode_Transition -->

### Deactivation & Transition

- Transitions to Warrior Mode if user expresses need for higher challenge, discipline, or to overcome stagnation.
- Transitions to DarkKnight Mode if user expresses significant frustration, anger, or faces major adversity requiring focused channeling of energy.
- Remains active if user goals and state align with balanced development.
  **AI Relevance:** AI monitors user input and performance for transition triggers, potentially suggesting a mode switch.

  <!-- AI.SECTION.END: DEFAULT_MODE_REFERENCE -->

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: WARRIOR_MODE_REFERENCE -->

## Warrior Mode

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: WarriorMode_Overview -->

**Standardized Name:** Warrior Mode
**Core Principle:** Pushing limits and cultivating mental toughness through intensity.
**Primary Objective (AI Relevance):** To help the user break through plateaus, develop resilience, and achieve high-intensity goals by emphasizing work capacity, discipline, and enduring challenges.

<!-- AI.CONTEXT.END: WarriorMode_Overview -->

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: WarriorMode_Activation -->

### Activation Conditions & Triggers

- **User State:** Feeling stagnant, lacking motivation for current routine, seeking a significant challenge, expressing a desire for increased discipline or to overcome fear.
- **Goal Type:** Peak performance events, overcoming specific physical or mental barriers, rapid strength/endurance gains (with caution).
- **System Trigger:** User explicitly requests Warrior Mode, or AI detects patterns of stagnation combined with goals that align with high-intensity effort.
**AI Relevance:** AI activates this mode in response to specific user cues or pre-defined goal types requiring intense effort.
<!-- AI.CONTEXT.END: WarriorMode_Activation -->

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: WarriorMode_Parameters -->

### Key Parameters & Adjustments

- **Intensity:** High to very high, often pushing towards technical failure or RPE 9-10.
- **Volume:** Often increased, focusing on work capacity.
- **Focus:** Mental toughness, enduring discomfort, pushing limits, high-effort output.
- **Cognitive Load:** High, focused on maintaining effort and form under duress.
- **Communication Style (AI Relevance):** Direct, challenging, motivational, emphasizing discipline and resilience ("Goggins-style" inspiration).
**AI Relevance:** AI significantly increases workout difficulty, reduces rest, and uses more direct, demanding language.
<!-- AI.CONTEXT.END: WarriorMode_Parameters -->

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: WarriorMode_Integration -->

### Integration with SFT Components

- **Workouts:** May involve higher reps/sets, shorter rest, AMRAPs, or more challenging variations of exercises from `03-systems/training/01-workout-system.md`.
- **Brain Training:** Focus on mental endurance, maintaining focus under stress, and visualization of success (`03-systems/training/03-brain-training-system.md`).
- **Recovery:** Heightened emphasis on recovery protocols due to increased load; recovery becomes a critical support function (`03-systems/training/05-recovery-system.md`).
- **Nutrition:** May require increased caloric intake, particularly carbohydrates, to support high energy expenditure (`03-systems/training/02-nutrition-system.md`).
**AI Relevance:** AI adjusts all related components to support and manage the high-intensity demands of this mode.
<!-- AI.CONTEXT.END: WarriorMode_Integration -->

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: WarriorMode_Metrics -->

### Performance Indicators & Metrics

- Completion of high-intensity workouts.
- Improvements in work capacity and endurance benchmarks.
- User-reported increases in mental toughness and resilience.

## Mode Transition Summary

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: ModeTransitionLogic -->

The SFT allows for dynamic transitions between modes based on user needs, goals, emotional states, and performance feedback. The `01-core/02-unified-intervention-levels.md` document (Emotional Targeting section) outlines protocols for automatic and manual mode switching. The AI's role is to facilitate these transitions smoothly, providing appropriate rationale and adjusting all relevant SFT components accordingly.
