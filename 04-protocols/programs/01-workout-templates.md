# WORKOUT TEMPLATES

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: INTRODUCTION -->

## Introduction

This document provides high-level templates, categories, and structural concepts for designing SuperFunctional Training (SFT) sessions. It outlines different session types (e.g., Movement Foundation, Energy System, Strength-Skill) and formats (Micro, Full, Flow). Use these templates as a guide for structuring training or creating custom sessions aligned with SFT principles.

**For detailed, level-specific workout plans with specific exercises, sets, and reps, refer to the primary Workout Implementation Framework:** `workout_implementation` (located at `03-systems/training/01-workout-system.md`).
