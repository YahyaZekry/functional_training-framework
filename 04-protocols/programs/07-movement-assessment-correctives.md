# SFT Movement Assessment & Corrective Strategy Protocol

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: INTRODUCTION -->

## Introduction

This document outlines the SuperFunctional Training (SFT) Movement Assessment protocol, designed to identify fundamental movement pattern limitations, asymmetries, and potential injury risks. It also provides a framework for linking assessment findings to targeted corrective strategies drawing from exercises and principles within the SFT system. This protocol informs individualization and ensures readiness for progressive training demands. It complements the general tracking metrics found in `progression_tracking`.

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: ASSESSMENT_PRINCIPLES -->

## Assessment Principles

- **Purpose:** To assess the quality of fundamental movement patterns, not maximal strength or capacity.
- **Context:** Perform when rested, before strenuous activity. Minimal instruction should be given beyond demonstrating the movement.
- **Observation:** Focus on quality, symmetry, and the presence of pain or compensation.
- **Scoring (Simplified):** Each test can be broadly categorized as Pass (competent execution), Pass with Compensation, or Fail (unable to perform or pain present). Detailed notes on specific limitations are crucial.
- **Goal:** Identify the _most significant_ movement limitation to prioritize for corrective action. Do not try to fix everything at once.

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: SFT_MOVEMENT_SCREEN -->

## SFT Movement Screen Protocol

This screen assesses key patterns relevant to the SFT framework.

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: Screen_DeepSquat -->

### 1. Deep Squat Assessment

- **Procedure:** Stand feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly out. Hold a dowel or light bar overhead with arms straight. Squat as deep as possible while keeping heels down, bar overhead, and torso upright.
- **Observe:** Depth achieved, heel lift, excessive forward lean, knee valgus (caving in), bar moving forward, asymmetry.
- **Potential Limitations Indicate Issues With:** Ankle dorsiflexion, hip flexion/external rotation, thoracic spine extension, core stability, shoulder mobility/stability.
<!-- AI.CONTEXT.END: Screen_DeepSquat -->

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: Screen_ASLR -->

### 2. Active Straight Leg Raise (ASLR)

- **Procedure:** Lie supine, legs straight, arms by sides. Keeping one leg flat on the ground, raise the other straight leg as high as possible without bending the knee or lifting the down leg/lower back. Measure ankle position relative to the down leg's knee/mid-thigh/hip. Test both sides.
- **Observe:** Height achieved, knee bend, movement of down leg or pelvis, asymmetry between sides.
- **Potential Limitations Indicate Issues With:** Hamstring flexibility, core stability, hip flexor activation on down leg.
<!-- AI.CONTEXT.END: Screen_ASLR -->

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: Screen_PushUp -->

### 3. Push-Up Stability Assessment

- **Procedure:** Perform standard push-ups (or appropriate regression like knee/incline).
- **Observe:** Scapular winging, excessive lumbar sag/arch, shoulder elevation, head/neck position, ability to maintain stable trunk throughout.
- **Potential Limitations Indicate Issues With:** Core stability (anterior), scapular stability/control (serratus anterior, lower traps), shoulder stability, triceps strength.
<!-- AI.CONTEXT.END: Screen_PushUp -->

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: Screen_Pulling -->

### 4. Pulling Pattern Assessment (e.g., Inverted Row / Bodyweight Row)

- **Procedure:** Perform inverted rows using a bar, rings, or suspension trainer, maintaining a straight body line.
- **Observe:** Ability to initiate with scapular retraction, shoulder elevation during pull, excessive body momentum/arching, asymmetry.
- **Potential Limitations Indicate Issues With:** Scapular retraction/depression strength (rhomboids, mid/lower traps), latissimus dorsi activation, core stability (posterior chain), grip strength.
<!-- AI.CONTEXT.END: Screen_Pulling -->

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: Screen_Lunge -->

### 5. Lunge Stability Assessment (Inline Lunge)

- **Procedure:** Stand with feet together. Step forward into a lunge, ensuring front knee tracks over ankle and back knee lightly touches ground directly below hip. Maintain upright torso. Return to start. Test both sides. (Can add holding dowel behind back for torso stability check).
- **Observe:** Knee valgus/varus, torso lean/rotation, balance loss, inability to control descent/ascent, asymmetry.
- **Potential Limitations Indicate Issues With:** Hip/knee/ankle mobility and stability, core control, balance, glute activation.
<!-- AI.CONTEXT.END: Screen_Lunge -->

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: Screen_GaitLocomotion -->

### 6. Gait / Basic Locomotion Assessment

- **Procedure:** Observe natural walking gait. Optionally, observe basic crawling patterns (e.g., bear crawl).
- **Observe (Walking):** Foot strike pattern, stride length symmetry, arm swing, hip/pelvis movement, excessive pronation/supination.
- **Observe (Crawling):** Contralateral movement timing, core stability, hip/shoulder dissociation, fluidity.
- **Potential Limitations Indicate Issues With:** Foot/ankle mechanics, hip mobility/stability, core control, coordination, overall movement integration.

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: CORRECTIVE_STRATEGY -->

## Corrective Strategy Framework

Based on the primary limitation identified in the screen:

1.  **Mobilize:** Address joint mobility restrictions first.
    - _Examples:_ Ankle dorsiflexion drills, hip flexor stretches, thoracic spine rotations.
    - _Reference:_ See Mobility sections in `workout_implementation`, `recovery_implementation`.
2.  **Activate:** Target underactive muscles responsible for stability or movement control.
    - _Examples:_ Glute bridges, band pull-aparts, bird-dogs, serratus wall slides.
    - _Reference:_ Foundational exercises in `workout_implementation` (Level 0/1), specific activation drills if detailed elsewhere.
3.  **Integrate/Pattern:** Re-train the movement pattern with improved mobility/activation, often using regressions or feedback tools.
    - _Examples:_ Goblet squats for squat pattern, dowel rod feedback for hinge, assisted push-ups focusing on scapular control.
    - _Reference:_ Movement Progression Standards in `workout_implementation`.

**Prioritization:** Focus corrective efforts on the most significant limitation identified before addressing secondary issues. Integrate correctives into warm-ups or as accessory work. Re-assess periodically.

**AI Relevance:** AI can guide the assessment, record observations, identify potential primary limitations based on common patterns, and suggest relevant corrective categories by referencing appropriate framework components.
