# SFT Level Transition Guidelines

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: INTRODUCTION -->

## Introduction

This document defines the specific criteria and performance benchmarks required to transition between the core SuperFunctional Training (SFT) Levels (0-3), as defined in `01-core/02-unified-intervention-levels.md`. Advancement is based on demonstrating consistent competency across the three pillars (Physical, Cognitive, Lifestyle) relevant to the current level, not just completion of a set time period. Metrics are drawn from `01-core/03-progression-tracking.md` and workout benchmarks from `03-systems/training/01-workout-system.md`.

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: GENERAL_PRINCIPLES -->

## General Transition Principles

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: TransitionPrinciple_Competency -->

### Competency Over Completion

Transition is based on demonstrating mastery of the current level's key skills and capacities, not simply completing workouts for a certain duration.

<!-- AI.CONTEXT.END: TransitionPrinciple_Competency -->

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: TransitionPrinciple_Holistic -->

### Holistic Assessment

Progress across all relevant domains (Movement, Energy Systems, Neural Integration, Recovery Management) should be considered. Significant lags in one area may warrant delaying transition, even if others are strong.

<!-- AI.CONTEXT.END: TransitionPrinciple_Holistic -->

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: TransitionPrinciple_Consistency -->

### Consistency is Key

Benchmarks should be met consistently over a period (e.g., 2-4 weeks) rather than just in a single peak performance test, demonstrating true adaptation.

<!-- AI.CONTEXT.END: TransitionPrinciple_Consistency -->

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: TransitionPrinciple_Individualization -->

### Individual Pace

The time spent at each level will vary significantly based on individual factors (training history, genetics, recovery, consistency, age - see `05-enhancements/02-demographic-adaptations/00-demographic-integration-overview.md`).

<!-- AI.CONTEXT.END: TransitionPrinciple_Individualization -->
<!-- AI.SECTION.END: GENERAL_PRINCIPLES -->

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: TRANSITION_0_TO_1 -->

## Transition Criteria: Level 0 (Foundation) → Level 1 (Pattern Development)

Focus: Demonstrating foundational movement competency, basic work capacity, and initial mind-body connection.

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: Criteria_0_1_Physical -->

### Physical Criteria

1.  **Workout Benchmark (O.N.E. Workout - `01-workout-system.md`):** Consistently complete the O.N.E. workout (100 Push Ups, 50 Pull Ups, 150 Air Squats) in under 8-10 minutes with good form on all repetitions (adjust time goal based on starting point, but significant improvement required).
2.  **Movement Quality:** Demonstrate proficiency in basic primal patterns (squat, hinge, push, pull, lunge, carry) with bodyweight, showing good core stability and joint control (assessed via Movement Screening in `03-progression-tracking.md`).

    <!-- AI.SECTION.END: TRANSITION_0_TO_1 -->

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: TRANSITION_1_TO_2 -->

## Transition Criteria: Level 1 (Pattern Development) → Level 2 (Advanced Integration)

Focus: Demonstrating proficiency with increased complexity, load, and volume; developing mind-muscle connection and basic power generation.

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: Criteria_1_2_Physical -->

### Physical Criteria

1.  **Workout Benchmarks (`01-workout-system.md` - Level 1):**
    - Consistently complete Level 1 workouts (Push, Pull, Legs/Core, Full Body) with good form using challenging weights (e.g., meeting rep targets close to technical failure as prescribed).
    - Demonstrate proficiency in compound lifts (e.g., Bench Press, Squat variations, Rows) with controlled technique.
    - Show capacity for volume (e.g., completing mechanical drop sets, complexes, and finishers without significant form breakdown).
2.  **Movement Quality:** Exhibit smooth transitions between exercises in complexes/circuits. Demonstrate improved coordination and stability in unilateral movements (e.g., Single Arm Dips, Walking Lunges).
3.  **Energy Systems:** Show improved work capacity and lactate tolerance (ability to maintain intensity during pump training protocols). Basic proficiency in conditioning finishers (Burpees, Battle Ropes).

## AI Implementation Notes

- The AI system should track the metrics outlined above, comparing user performance against these benchmarks.
- Transition should not be solely based on hitting a single benchmark but on demonstrating consistent competency across the relevant physical, cognitive, and lifestyle criteria for the current level.
- The AI can prompt the user for readiness assessment when benchmarks are consistently met, suggesting a potential transition to the next level's focus.
- These guidelines provide a baseline; the AI should allow for some flexibility based on individual goals and progress rates.
