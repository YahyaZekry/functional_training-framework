# SFT Movement Assessment & Corrective Strategy Protocol

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: INTRODUCTION -->

## Introduction

This document outlines the SuperFunctional Training (SFT) Movement Assessment protocol, designed to identify fundamental movement pattern limitations, asymmetries, and potential injury risks. It also provides a framework for linking assessment findings to targeted corrective strategies drawing from exercises and principles within the SFT system. This protocol informs individualization and ensures readiness for progressive training demands. It complements the general tracking metrics found in `progression_tracking`.

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: ASSESSMENT_PRINCIPLES -->

## Assessment Principles

- **Purpose:** To assess the quality of fundamental movement patterns, not maximal strength or capacity.
- **Context:** Perform when rested, before strenuous activity. Minimal instruction should be given beyond demonstrating the movement.
- **Observation:** Focus on quality, symmetry, and the presence of pain or compensation. Use multiple viewing angles (front, side, back).
- **Scoring (Simplified):** Each test can be broadly categorized as **Pass** (competent execution without pain or significant compensation), **Pass with Compensation** (completes movement but with noted deviations), or **Fail** (unable to perform pattern or pain present). Detailed notes on specific limitations are crucial.
- **Goal:** Identify the _most significant_ movement limitation (often the lowest scoring pattern or one involving pain) to prioritize for corrective action. Do not try to fix everything at once.

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: SFT_MOVEMENT_SCREEN -->

## SFT Movement Screen Protocol

This screen assesses key patterns relevant to the SFT framework. Perform 3-5 repetitions per side where applicable.

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: Screen_DeepSquat -->

### 1. Deep Squat Assessment

- **Procedure:** Stand feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly out. Hold a dowel or light bar overhead with arms straight, elbows locked. Squat as deep as possible while keeping heels down, bar directly overhead (or slightly behind), and torso as upright as possible.
- **Key Observations for Compensation/Fail:**
  - Heels lift off ground.
  - Knees collapse inward (valgus).
  - Excessive forward torso lean (torso parallel to shins or more).
  - Dowel moves significantly forward relative to feet.
  - Noticeable asymmetry between sides.
  - Pain during movement.
- **Potential Limitations Indicate Issues With:** Ankle dorsiflexion, hip flexion/external rotation, thoracic spine extension, core stability, shoulder mobility/stability, motor control.

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: Screen_ASLR -->

### 2. Active Straight Leg Raise (ASLR)

- **Procedure:** Lie supine, legs straight, toes pointing up, arms by sides palms down. Keeping one leg completely flat (knee locked, toes up), raise the other straight leg (knee locked, toes up) as high as possible. Assess the highest point the ankle reaches relative to the down leg (below knee, knee to mid-thigh, above mid-thigh). Test both sides.
- **Key Observations for Compensation/Fail:**
  - Ankle does not pass mid-thigh of down leg.
  - Knee on moving leg bends.
  - Down leg lifts off the floor or rotates outward.
  - Pelvis tilts / lower back arches significantly.
  - Noticeable asymmetry (>1 category difference) between sides.
  - Pain during movement.
- **Potential Limitations Indicate Issues With:** Hamstring flexibility, core stability (preventing pelvic tilt), hip flexor activation/strength on down leg, neuromuscular control.

<!-- AI.CONTEXT.END: Screen_ASLR -->

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: Screen_PushUp -->

### 3. Push-Up Stability Assessment

- **Procedure:** Assume push-up position (or appropriate regression: knees, incline). Perform push-ups maintaining a straight line from head to heels (or knees).
- **Key Observations for Compensation/Fail:**
  - Scapulae wing significantly (medial border lifts off ribcage).
  - Lumbar spine sags (hyperextension) or arches excessively (flexion).
  - Shoulders shrug up towards ears.
  - Failure to maintain rigid torso throughout the movement.
  - Pain during movement.
- **Potential Limitations Indicate Issues With:** Core stability (anterior chain, anti-extension), scapular stability/control (serratus anterior, lower/mid traps), shoulder stability, triceps strength, motor control.

<!-- AI.CONTEXT.END: Screen_PushUp -->

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: Screen_Pulling -->

### 4. Pulling Pattern Assessment (e.g., Inverted Row / Bodyweight Row)

- **Procedure:** Perform inverted rows using a bar, rings, or suspension trainer. Maintain a straight line from head to heels. Pull chest towards hands.
- **Key Observations for Compensation/Fail:**
  - Inability to initiate pull with scapular retraction (shoulders roll forward).
  - Shoulders elevate significantly towards ears during pull.
  - Hips sag or body arches excessively to complete pull.
  - Noticeable asymmetry in pull strength or shoulder position.
  - Pain during movement.
- **Potential Limitations Indicate Issues With:** Scapular retraction/depression strength (rhomboids, mid/lower traps), latissimus dorsi activation, core stability (anti-flexion), grip strength, biceps strength.

<!-- AI.CONTEXT.END: Screen_Pulling -->

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: Screen_Lunge -->

### 5. Lunge Stability Assessment (Inline Lunge)

- **Procedure:** Stand tall, feet together. Step forward into a lunge, aiming for 90-degree angles at both knees. Back knee should lightly touch ground directly below or slightly behind hip. Torso remains upright. Return to start under control. Test both sides. (Optional: Hold dowel along spine).
- **Key Observations for Compensation/Fail:**
  - Front knee collapses inward (valgus) or outward (varus).
  - Significant loss of balance (needing to touch down hand or step out).
  - Torso leans excessively forward, backward, or sideways.
  - Inability to control descent or ascent smoothly.
  - Noticeable asymmetry between sides.
  - Pain during movement.
- **Potential Limitations Indicate Issues With:** Hip mobility (flexion/extension), ankle mobility (dorsiflexion), knee stability, hip stability (glute medius), core control (anti-rotation/lateral flexion), balance/proprioception.

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: Screen_GaitLocomotion -->

### 6. Gait / Basic Locomotion Assessment

- **Procedure:** Observe natural walking gait (approx 10-15 meters). Optionally, observe basic crawling (e.g., bear crawl) for contralateral coordination.
- **Key Observations for Compensation/Fail:**
  - **Walking:** Noticeable limp, asymmetry in stride length/arm swing, excessive foot pronation/supination, significant hip drop (Trendelenburg sign), forward head posture, lack of hip extension, foot slapping. Pain.
  - **Crawling:** Inability to maintain stable spine, lack of contralateral timing (arm/leg moving together on same side), excessive hip sway, inability to dissociate hips/shoulders. Pain.
- **Potential Limitations Indicate Issues With:** Foot/ankle mechanics, hip mobility/stability, core control, coordination, neurological issues, overall movement integration.

<!-- AI.SECTION.START: CORRECTIVE_STRATEGY -->

## Corrective Strategy Framework

Based on the primary limitation identified in the screen (lowest scoring pattern or pattern causing pain):

1.  **Mobilize:** Address joint mobility or tissue extensibility restrictions first.

    - _Examples:_ Ankle dorsiflexion drills, hip flexor stretches, thoracic spine rotations.
    - _Reference:_ See Mobility sections in `workout_implementation`, `recovery_implementation`, `foundation_fascia_training`.

2.  **Activate/Stabilize:** Target underactive muscles responsible for stability or core control.

    - _Examples:_ Glute bridges, band pull-aparts, bird-dogs, serratus wall slides.
    - _Reference:_ Foundational exercises in `workout_implementation` (Level 0/1), specific activation drills if detailed elsewhere (e.g., `foundation_movement_culture` for core).

3.  **Integrate/Pattern:** Re-train the fundamental movement pattern with improved mobility/activation, often using regressions, feedback tools, or specific cues.
    - _Examples:_ Goblet squats for squat pattern, dowel rod feedback for hinge, assisted push-ups focusing on scapular control.
    - _Reference:_ Movement Progression Standards in `workout_implementation`, `foundation_movement_culture`.

**Prioritization:** Focus corrective efforts on the single most significant limitation identified before addressing secondary issues. Integrate correctives into warm-ups or as accessory work (1-2 exercises per session). Re-assess the screen periodically (e.g., every 4-6 weeks) to monitor progress and adjust corrective focus.

**AI Relevance:** AI can guide the assessment, record observations (potentially via user input or future video analysis integration), identify potential primary limitations based on common fault patterns, and suggest relevant corrective _categories_ by referencing appropriate framework components for specific exercises.
