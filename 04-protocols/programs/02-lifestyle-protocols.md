# Example Lifestyle Schedules

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: INTRODUCTION -->

## Introduction

This document provides illustrative examples of how SuperFunctional Training (SFT) principles and protocols can be integrated into daily and weekly schedules. These are templates and should be adapted based on individual goals, SFT Level, chosen Mode, recovery capacity, and life circumstances. Refer to the core system documents (e.g., `lifestyle_system`, `workout_implementation`, `recovery_implementation`) for detailed protocols.

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: EXAMPLE_LEVEL1_WEEK -->

## Example: Level 1 (Pattern Development) - Default Mode Week

**Goal Focus:** Building work capacity, mastering compound lifts, integrating basic lifestyle practices.

- **Monday:**
  - Morning: Wake Protocol, Light Mobility (10 min). Breakfast (Reset Diet).
  - Workday: Movement Breaks (squats, push-ups), Standing Desk periods. Lunch (Reset Diet). Incidental Grip Training.
  - Evening: **Full Session - Push Day** (Level 1 Workout). Post-workout Nutrition. Dinner. Wind-down Routine (Meditation/Reading).
- **Tuesday:**
  - Morning: Wake Protocol, Active Recovery (Walk/Light Flow - 15 min). Breakfast.
  - Workday: Similar to Monday.
  - Evening: Brain Training Session (Level 1 - e.g., N-Back + Visualization). Dinner. Family/Social Time. Wind-down.
- **Wednesday:**
  - Morning: Wake Protocol, Light Mobility. Breakfast.
  - Workday: Similar to Monday.
  - Evening: **Full Session - Pull Day** (Level 1 Workout). Post-workout Nutrition. Dinner. Wind-down.
- **Thursday:**
  - Morning: Wake Protocol, Active Recovery (Walk/Light Flow - 15 min). Breakfast.
  - Workday: Similar to Monday.
  - Evening: Brain Training Session (Level 1 - e.g., Meditation Complex). Dinner. Skill Practice (e.g., Handstand progression from Movement Culture). Wind-down.
- **Friday:**
  - Morning: Wake Protocol, Light Mobility. Breakfast.
  - Workday: Similar to Monday.
  - Evening: **Full Session - Legs/Core Day** (Level 1 Workout). Post-workout Nutrition. Dinner. Wind-down.
- **Saturday:**
  - Morning: Wake Protocol. Longer Outdoor Activity (Hike, Sport, Play - Environmental Adaptation).
  - Afternoon: Meal Prep / Free Time.
  - Evening: Social/Family Time. Wind-down.
- **Sunday:**
  - Active Recovery / Rest: Longer Mobility/Yoga session, light walk, or complete rest based on feel. Meal Prep. Plan week ahead. Wind-down.

**Notes:** Nutrition follows Reset Diet principles. Micro-workouts (Neck, Grip) integrated opportunistically. Sleep schedule consistent.

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: EXAMPLE_LEVEL2_DAY_WARRIOR -->

## Example: Level 2 (Advanced Integration) - Warrior Mode Day

**Goal Focus:** Pushing work capacity and mental toughness.

- **Morning (Early):** Wake Protocol (Cold Exposure option). Intense Brain Training (Focus under simulated stress). Pre-workout Nutrition.
- **Training Session:** **Full Body Power Workout** (Level 2) - Executed with high intensity, minimal rest focus, pushing rep boundaries safely. Warrior Mode communication cues used mentally or by AI.
- **Post-Workout:** Immediate Recovery Nutrition. Enhanced Recovery Modality (e.g., Contrast Shower).
- **Workday:** Focused work blocks. Movement breaks are short, intense (e.g., max push-ups). Manage nutrition for high energy demands.
- **Evening:** Active Recovery (light walk/mobility). Meal focused on recovery. Strict Wind-down Routine to maximize sleep quality (essential after high intensity). Review training performance critically.
<!-- AI.CONTEXT.END: EXAMPLE_LEVEL2_DAY_WARRIOR -->

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: EXAMPLE_REST_DAY -->

## Example: Active Rest Day (Any Level)

**Goal Focus:** Facilitating recovery, light skill practice, lifestyle integration.

- **Morning:** Wake Protocol (focus on relaxation). Gentle Mobility / Movement Flow (15-20 min) or Light Walk in nature. Breakfast.
- **Day:** Normal daily activities. Incorporate incidental movement (walking, stairs, position changes). Focus on hydration and nutrient-dense foods supporting recovery. Optional light skill practice (e.g., balance, hand-eye coordination) if feeling good.
- **Evening:** Stress Management Practice (Meditation, Breathing). Prepare for next training day (mentally, logistically). Prioritize Wind-down Routine and Sleep Optimization.
